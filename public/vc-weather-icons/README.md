In practice this means you can do pretty much anything with these icons. The only restriction is that as long as the originals are remotely recognisable, either because you are using them as-is or because you modified them not too dramatically, then you must visibly mention my name somewhere in your product where users can see it. You can either use “Dr. Lex” or “Alexander Thomas”. You can link to my website <https://www.dr-lex.be/> if you wish, but you don't have to. There is no need to contact me if you provide the required attribution, and there is no requirement to share profits.
